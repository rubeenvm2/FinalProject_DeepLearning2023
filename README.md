## Information

This repository contains the final project for the Deep Learning 2023 course. The project is focused on object detection for self-driving vehicles. The repository is divided into three parts:

1. **Mandatory Part:** This section includes instructions on how to set up the Google Colab environment and clone the necessary GitHub repositories.

2. **YOLOv5:** In this part, we utilize the Ultralytics YOLOv5 framework to train and test our object detection model. We have the option to apply our own data augmentation techniques or configure the hyperparameters to evaluate and compare the results.

3. **YOLO from Scratch:** Here, we present our own implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model from scratch. We discuss the architecture, training process, and evaluation results.

## Results

The results of our experiments and evaluations can be found in the respective sections of this repository. We provide detailed analyses and comparisons of the object detection models implemented in this project.

For more information, please refer to the individual sections and files within this repository.
